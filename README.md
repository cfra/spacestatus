SpaceStatus
===========

This is an extension for chromium which displays the status of your favorite
hackerspace directly in your browser, using the SpaceAPI.

If you don't want to build the extension yourself, you can install it from

Installing chrome extensions which do not come from Google's webstore is somewhat
tough. The only way to do so which I found yet, is to open the _Extensions_ page and
drag the `crx` file there, either directly from the downloads bar or from your
filemanager.
